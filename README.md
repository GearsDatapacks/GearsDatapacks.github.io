# Gears' Website

Code for [my website](https://gearsco.de), written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run),
using [Lustre](https://lustre.build) and [Lustre SSG](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre_ssg).

I have recently restructured the website from a multi-page site to an SPA, so for
now Lustre SSG is overkill for what I need, and the codebase is a little messy.
I do want to eventually make a blog and other pages for this site, so at some point
it will get another rewrite.

For an example of Gleam/Lustre SSG, see: https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/giacomocavalieri.me
