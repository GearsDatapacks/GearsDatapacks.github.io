  desc: "Fungecraft is a Minecraft version of the esoteric programming language Befunge, using Minecraft blocks instead of ASCII Characters.<br/>
  <br/>
  Fungecraft is to date one of my favourite packs that I've worked on. It was my first real computational datapack, and it was a lot of fun to work on.<br/>
  With the making of it, I was able to prove that mcfunction was turing complete, which cool. I was also very passionate about esolangs at the time, hence the reason for making it.<br/>
  <br/>
  I made Fungecraft before string parsing was a thing, so I used blocks instead of a book as input.<br/>
  I think Fungecraft helped me get into the mindset of this kind of datapack, and allowed me to later go on to make far more complex packs, such as Code of Copper."
