Gadgets is a datapack that I made when I was feeling motivated, but didn't have any good ideas. I'm not particularly proud of it, but I guess it's an interesting pack.\
\
It's not very original, which is why I don't care much for it. I guess I learned something about datapacks while making it, but overall it was just me trying to get some views and downloads as I hadn't really posted a datapack in a while.
